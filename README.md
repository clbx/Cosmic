Cosmic is a fully simulated computer architecture that provides a full environment to use the Cosmic Processor, specialized devices, ROM, RAM, graphics, and more. The cosmic processor can also be used on a Raspberry Pi to interface with real-world devices. The cosmic system is all entirely accessible in a rich GUI interface that allows for full customization of the system environment and code execution.*

Cosmic is designed to act similar to a real, physical chip but take advantage of it being software-based and leaving some of the nuances of the physical world behind.*

With an instruction set that makes sense (and is fun), and simple memory-mapped I/O, Cosmic is an excellent "chip" to write for, using the cosmic assembler.*
